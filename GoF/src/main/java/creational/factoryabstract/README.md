# Abstract Factory pattern

> Factory of related objects

Java API:
1. DocumentBuilder
2. More examples in frameworks


## Design Considerations


## Pitfalls 
1. Complex
2. Runtime switch
3. Pattern within a pattern
4. Problem specific
5. Starts with Factory, becomes Abstract factory

## Compared to other design patterns 


| Abstract Factory                  | Factory                             |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Implmented with a Factory n         |  Returns various instances      |
| Hides the Factory      |   Multiple constructors |
| Abstracts environment                   | Interface Driven                |
| Built through Composition             | Adaptable to environment more easily          |
